Paint Calculator 

This Python code calculates the area of a room that needs to be painted and estimates the total cost of paint needed based on the cost per square meter. It does this by asking the user to enter the dimesnions of a room and then prompts the user for dimesions of unpaintable areas such as doors or windows. Here's how to use it: 

1. Run the Python code in a Python supported environment. 

2. Enter the dimensions of the room when prompted. You will be asked for the Width, Height, and Length of the room. 

3. If there are any areas in the room that cannot be painted, such as windows or doors, enter "Yes" when prompted. Otherwise, enter "No". 

4. If you answered "Yes" to the previous question, you will be asked to enter the number of areas that cannot be painted and the dimensions of each area. Enter these values when prompted. 

5. The program will calculate the area of the floor, the area of the surfaces that can be painted, and the volume of the room. It will then output this information. 

6. You will be asked to enter the cost of paint per square meter. 

7. The program will calculate the total cost of the paint needed to paint the room and output this information. 


Assumptions: The output of the program is in square meters and assumes a flat surface. The actual amount of paint needed may vary based on the number of coats and type of paint you may use.
